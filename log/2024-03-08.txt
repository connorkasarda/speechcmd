Packages I may want to use ...

<speech recognition> will be perfect for detecting and digitizing speech from
the user's microphone. In addition, the library permits external engines and
APIs: OpenAI whisper, Tensorflow, IBM Speech to Text.

<Python Auto GUI> enables control of the mouse and keyboard via scripts.

<Hugging Face> contains transformers, datasets, tokenizers, and training for
NLP type tasks. The system will need to learn how to understand the authorized
user, etc.

<OpenAI Whisper> works offline (that's a huge plus!) and can perform
multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language 
identification if needed. The program is trained on a large corpus of diverse
audio.

My plan is to begin this project using such packages: standing on the shoulders
of giants. Then, perhaps once I have learned more about the innerworkings of
such technology, I can implement these abilities myself.
